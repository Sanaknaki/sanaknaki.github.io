                        So today I applied to some jobs (hope the recruiters are reading this ..) and then thought I had an hour or 2 or 8 to kill so I
                        decided to draw up an Instagram Mac application, because every single UI designer has to, at least once in their lives, attempt
                        to re-design a famous website or app, I don't know why, but it's nice to look at. So <a href="../instapp/index.html">here</a> it is!

                    <h5>
                        I feel like I should have a blog in order to just keep myself in track, for no other reason, literally just so I can look back and be like 'Oh haha I remember when 
                        I started that one project and never finished it, oh look there was a timestamp too!'. But yeah this is what this will be for, currently haven't done much, I mean 
                        I graduated so that's pretty awesome, and now hunting for jobs is the real work, need to put this degree to use.
                    </h5>

                    <h5>
                        I prefer looking for jobs related to web development (full-stack) or some form of UI/UX position, so if you guys know anyone looking a new-grad, let me know.
